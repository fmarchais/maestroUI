# maestroUI
A shiny app to visualize {maestro} pipelines

It is still in early development and needs a bit of tweaking to create the logs.csv

More documentation will be added soon


TODO :
- Fix bug : In Posit Connect Cloud, the errors logs do not appear. Merging error based on utc/local time ?
- Create new tab for creating pipelines
- Create a new panel to visualise day/week/month scheduling times for existing pipelines
- Create a new panel to visualise DAGs
